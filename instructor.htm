			<h2>Master Lu Xiaolin</h2>
			<div id="SiFuSection"><!--  aboutUs -->
				<p>With the tutelage of four great masters, Lu Xiaolin developed into a competition champion. Master Lu became a seven-time Teen Champion in the annual Sichuan Province Martial Arts Championships. At age 16 in 1977 she won a bronze medal in the National Martial Arts Championship, and in 1983, after winning dozens of other competitions, she became a gold medalist in the National Martial Arts Open. Two years later she gained her highest all-China award to date: First Level winner at the 1985 National Martial Arts Open Championships, performing a straight sword form of her own creation. Also in 1985, Master Lu gained broader recognition by being certified by the Chinese as a First Level Martial Artist and as a First Level National Wushu Judge.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>It was in this same period that she was assigned by the Chinese government to go to the Shaolin temple and help re-establish the ancient kung-fu training program there. After earning a bachelor's degree in Martial Arts from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education in 1982, she returned to her native Chengdu to be an instructor for seven years at the Chengdu Institute of Physical Education, where she earned a master's degree in 1987.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Master Lu's introduction to America came in 1989 when she traveled to Los Angeles to win two gold medals at the International Martial Arts Championship. In 1992, she opened her O-Mei Wushu Kungfu Center in Alexandria, Virginia which has produced many wushu champions and USA wushu team members such as Louis Diaz, Anita Lopez, Clara Shen, Vraja Groover, Kelly Cramp, Deborah Yang, Denise Lane and An Nguyen. Master Lu was the U.S. wushu team coach in 1993-1996. She represented the U.S. as a judge in the 1997 Rome and 1999 Hong Kong World Wushu Championships.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Recently, Master Lu received a seventh duan from the Chinese ranking system of the International Wushu Federation and she is the youngest to receive that honor. She is active in the United States of America Wushu Kungfu Federation (USAWKF) both as an official as well as a liaison. She is the chairperson for the Pan-American Technical Committee.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Master Lu has many years of experience in teaching which is why the O-Mei students, besides learning Wushu, also learn good behavior, problem solving, proper conduct and etiquette. Clara Shen (senior O-mei student) said "O-Mei and Sifu Lu taught me a lot which helped me in getting into Harvard University. Sifu Lu gives me a lot support".</p>
